# MENTAL-HEALTH-ANALYSIS-AND-VISUALIZATION
This project provides valuable insights into mental health issues

 # Project Overview
 This project analyzes mental health data using SQL and visualizes the findings with Power BI. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights related to mental health issues across different demographics, occupations, and regions. The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations, including the distribution of coping struggles between genders and the count of family history having mental health problems, with slicers for year, country, and gender

# Tools and Technologies
SQL: Used for data querying and analysis.
Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards

# Key Metrics and Visuals

* Gender and Coping Struggles:
Analyzes how different genders cope with mental health struggles.

* Occupation and Growing Stress:
Examines the correlation between various occupations and increasing stress levels.

* Family History of Mental Health Issues:
Counts the number of individuals with a family history of mental health problems.

* Gender and Treatment Received:
Identifies how many individuals from different genders have received mental health treatment.

* Country, Gender, and Family History:
Compares the number of individuals with a family history of mental health issues across different countries and genders.

* Country, Gender, and Growing Stress:
Analyzes the prevalence of growing stress among different genders and countries.

*Country and Mood Swings:
Investigates the distribution of mood swings across various countries.

*Gender and Family History:
Counts the number of individuals with a family history of mental health issues segmented by gender.

*Gender and Mental Health Treatment:
Analyzes the number of individuals who have received mental health treatment, segmented by gender.

*Days Indoors and Habit Changes:
Examines how the number of days spent indoors affects habit changes.

* Days Indoors and Coping Struggles:
Investigates how the number of days spent indoors affects coping struggles.

* Gender and Mental Health Interview:
